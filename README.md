# lemon_quality_dataset

### Usage
i wanted to use basic neural networks for image classification <br>
so i chose the lemon quality dataset from kaggle: <br>
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yusufemir/lemon-quality-dataset?resource=download <br>
i implemented several neural networks with tensorflow, tried out different dataset splits, added a convolutional layer and used transfer learning <br>
find out which network architecture led to the best accuracy score


### Installation
use a virtual environment and install the requirements

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
